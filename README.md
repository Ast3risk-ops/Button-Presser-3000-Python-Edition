# Button Presser 3000 Python Edition
 The source code for my "game", designed to be as bad and boring as possible.

### Why is the windows version so big?

This is because the windows exe needs a bunch of other files to work because of the tk element.

## How to run

On Windows, just download the exe from itch.io or from GitHub

On MacOS and Linux download the py file from the releases or itch.io

# A note on this project's origins

I got the idea for this project from a book on bad games by Stuart Ashen that added a bonus bad game for the Spectrum. A picture of the joke "cover" (Also sorry if this angers you, Stuart):

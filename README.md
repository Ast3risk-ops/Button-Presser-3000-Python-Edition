# Button Presser 3000 Python Edition
 The source code for my "game", designed to be as bad and boring as possible.

 
 ### Why is the windows version so big?

 This is because the windows exe needs a bunch of other files to work because of the tk element.

## How to run

on Windows, just download the exe from itch.io or from GitHub

On MacOS and Linux download the py file from the releases or itch.io
